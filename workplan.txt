Dairy & Notes:
	Hope i can finish it
	Look at the thumbnail.png may be helpful, if u want to give up (whatever things
		——it's true
	The male name Hu Da means the first born of Hu family, but (Huda) also means allah in Northwest china，just a funny fact
	If u want to make paradox 3D models, use blender (ver<4.4.2), it's small and compatible, (it cost me a lot of time to find this
	A 3d model is added through the following levels of files: 
		.mesh(\gfx\models\portraits, the model)
		<->.asset(same place, u create entity)
		<->name accessories under \gfx\portraits\accessories
		<->log ur acces~ris in genelist at \common\genes
		<->add the logged models into the game (barbershop/characters) at gfx\portraits\portrait_modifiers
	Making mod is so fking difficult, hate debugginng
	i make a maintenance list in the dir of this file, if one day im too busy to update it, anyone can update the mod (,i think)
		YOU CAN DO IT   I'M SURE
