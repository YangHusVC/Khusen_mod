 ks_mod_events.0001.desc: "My liege, have you ever heard the tales of the fox spirits from the East? It is said that foxes, after long years of cultivation, can take on human form, most often appearing as women.\nSome say they are cunning and capricious, skilled at beguiling mortals with their beauty, draining their essence, leaving them dazed and weakened. Yet folk tales also tell of foxes who, when aided by humans, remember such kindness, taking human shape to repay the debt or secretly protecting a household from disaster.\nThus, in both records and legends, the fox spirit may be a demonic seducer, or a grateful spirit ofgratitude. To mortals, they are beings both feared and revered."
